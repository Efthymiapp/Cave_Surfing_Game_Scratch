# 🎮 Cave Surfing – Scratch Game
This project was developed as part of my pedagogical training, with the goal of combining creativity and programming through educational game design on the Scratch platform.

## 🧠 Educational Purpose
The game is designed to introduce basic programming concepts, such as motion, loops, conditionals, and user interaction. It also encourages problem-solving and reflex coordination, making it suitable for classroom activities or individual exploration.

## 🕹️ Game Description
Cave Surfing is an endless runner-style game where the player controls a sprite that continuously moves along the x-axis, giving the illusion of flying through a cave. The player must avoid obstacles that appear at regular intervals.

The sprite appears to move automatically to the left, simulating forward motion.

Obstacles are generated every 4 seconds and move toward the player.

The player can use the up and down arrow keys to move the sprite vertically.

A 15-second grace period is given at the start before obstacles appear.

The score increases by 3 every 400ms as long as the player survives.

If the sprite collides with an obstacle, the game ends.

## 👨‍🏫 Pedagogical Context
This project reflects the principles of constructivist learning, where students engage with interactive environments to explore, create, and learn through experimentation. It is suitable for use in primary or lower secondary educational settings.
